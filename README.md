# Web Mining & NLP - Module 3: Applying Matplotlib and pyplot

## Summary
In this project, we use Python's Matplotlib library and pyplot module to analyze and visualize data on both line and bar charts.

## Skills Used
- VS Code
- GitHub
- Git
- Python
- Jupyter

## Libraries and Modules 
- __numpy:__ Used for numerical and scientific computing. Specifically used for the random number generator in this project.
- __Matplotlib:__ Used for creating static, animated, and interactive visualizations.
- __pyplot:__ Used for plotting data on figures in order to visualize data findings.

## Needed Pip Install Commands
It is recommended to setup and activate a virtual environment for your project before installing all your needed libraries. See how to setup your virtual environment here: https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/python/python-tutorial#_create-a-virtual-environment
- python -m pip install -U matplotlib
- pip install numpy

## Key Learnings
1. How to setup figures in matplotlib.pyplot to be plotted on
2. How to filter through a dictionary comprehension for certain characters
3. How to adjust properties such as color, marker, size, linestyle, etc. on either scatter or line plots
4. How to adjust readablity of charts via log and grid additions
